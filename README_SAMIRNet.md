# SAMIRNet: SAM-based Infrared Small Target Detection Network

## Overview

SAMIRNet is a novel infrared small target detection network that combines:
- **Swin Transformer**: Pretrained image encoder for robust feature extraction
- **FPN Detector**: Feature Pyramid Network for center point detection
- **SAM-like Decoder**: Prompt-based mask decoder for precise segmentation
